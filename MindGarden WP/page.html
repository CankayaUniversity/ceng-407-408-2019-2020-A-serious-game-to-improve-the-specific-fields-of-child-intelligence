        <h1>Education with Entertainment</h1>
        <p>Nowadays, the use of simulations and serious games in learning and assessment is widespread. Serious games used for purposes other than mere entertainment. The starting point is the concept of the serious game itself, and what the means. Serious games are allowed learners to experience some situations that are impossible in the real world for different reasons like safety, cost, time, etc. However, they are also claimed to have positive impacts on the players' development of several different skills. Although there is much theoretical support for the benefits of digital games in learning and education, there is mixed empirical support. In this report, we searched about how to improve the children's mental capabilities using games.</p>
        <p>Using serious games, we are not only making education entertaining, but we also accustom students for licensed education by understanding which learning the student prone. So it is an excellent way to boost the mental skills of children. Creating one serious game to address children's attention is nearly impossible, so in our game, we are creating a game platform that contains different types of serious games. So, the purpose of "Mind Garden" is preparing children for education in every way possible. We shall design and create games that must be verified by a pedagogue. These games will dedicate what is the best learning style of our users, improve their other learning styles, boost their mental skills, and prepare them for education. It will be a standalone application. The innovative side of our application is that it is endless. Game developers could always come up with more types and more designs of serious games that could be implemented on our platform. The ability to add more types and more designs of serious games could increase relevancy to our application and address more users and developers. So it is a never stopping platform.</p>
        <p>Mind Garden is a game platform that contains multiple serious games for improving the mental skills of children, determining which learning style is suitable for children, and creating a healthy, entertaining environment for children to prepare their mindset for education in a positive way. The game will have two paths to follow. The routine mode includes a set of games that the user must spare time to play it. Games will be played consecutively. These routines will measure daily improvement, and a graph will be generated according to the data. Training mode enables the user to play whatever game he/she wants to play. The process will not affect the graph, and it is an excellent way to train and improve players' talent for specific games. Games have different objectives and play styles, so they address different types of mental skills. The main aspects of our games are mathematics, grammar, science, and memory. These aspects are the foundations of most of the proficiency.</p>
